This Android application code consists of assignment given by TrueCaller.

Problem statement of the assignment is to basically solve 3 condiontions,

The app should define and run 3 requests SIMULTANEOUSLY, each request is defined below:
1. Truecaller10thCharacterRequest:
I. Grab https://blog.truecaller.com/2018/01/22/life-as-an-android-engineer/
content from the web
II. Find the 10th character and display it on the screen
2. TruecallerEvery10thCharacterRequest:
I. Grab https://blog.truecaller.com/2018/01/22/life-as-an-android-engineer/
content from the web
II. Find every 10th character (i.e. 10th, 20th, 30th, etc.) and display the array on the
screen
3. TruecallerWordCounterRequest:
I. Grab https://blog.truecaller.com/2018/01/22/life-as-an-android-engineer/
content from the web
II.
Split the text into words using whitespace characters (i.e. space, tab, line break,
etc.), count the occurrence of every unique word (case insensitive) and display
the count for each word on the screen
Disregard any HTML/JavaScript. Consider the content as plain text and treat anything separated
by whitespace characters as a single word.
Example:
"<p> Truecaller Hello World </p>" should produce +1 for each of these: "<p>", "Truecaller",
"Hello", "World", and "</p>".
The application should show:
 1. A single Button to run the three requests SIMULTANEOUSLY
 2. A single TextView for each request to be updated as soon as the processing of the
corresponding request finishes
